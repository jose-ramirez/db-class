<!--
    Question 2
    In this question, you are to create a DTD for a different version of the 
    data set drawn from the Stanford course catalog. This version encodes 
    the data using ID and IDREF(S) attributes.

    Write a DTD for the XML data set.
    Hint: You may want to use your DTD from the previous question as a 
    starting point, since the structure is similar.
