1.  Return the names of all countries with population greater than 100 million.

    //country[data(@population) > 100000000]/data(@name)

2.  Return the names of all countries where over 50% of the population speaks 
	German. (Hint: Depending on your solution, you may want to use ".", which
	refers to the "current element" within an XPath expression.)

    //country[language[text() = "German" and data(@percentage) > 50]]/data(@name)

3.  Return the names of all countries where a city in that country contains
	more than one-third of the country's population.

    //country[city/population > (data(@population) div 3)]/data(@name)

4.  Return the population density of Qatar. Note: Since the "/" operator has
    its own meaning in XPath and XQuery, the division operator is "div". To
    compute population density use "(@population div @area)".

    //country[@name = "Qatar"]/(@population div @area)

5.  Return the names of all countries whose population is less than one
    thousandth that of some city (in any country).

    //country[1000 * @population < following::city/population or
    1000 * @population < preceding::city/population]/data(@name)

6.  Return all city names that appear more than once, i.e., there is more than
    one city with that name in the data. Return only one instance of each such
    city name. (Hint: You might want to use the "preceding" and/or "following"
    navigation axes for this query, which were not covered in the video or our
    demo script; they match any preceding or following node, not just siblings.)

    //city[name = following::name]/name

7.  Return the names of all countries containing a city such that some other
    country has a city of the same name. (Hint: You might want to use the
    "preceding" and/or "following" navigation axes for this query, which were
    not covered in the video or our demo script; they match any preceding or
    following node, not just siblings.)

    //country[following::city/name = ./city/name or
    preceding::city/name = ./city/name]/data(@name)

8.  Return the names of all countries whose name textually contains a language
    spoken in that country. For instance, Uzbek is spoken in Uzbekistan, so
    return Uzbekistan. (Hint: You may want to use ".", which refers to the
    "current element" within an XPath expression.)

    //country[language[contains(../data(@name),./text())]]/data(@name)

9.  Return the names of all countries in which people speak a language whose
    name textually contains the name of the country. For instance, Japanese is
    spoken in Japan, so return Japan. (Hint: You may want to use ".", which
    refers to the "current element" within an XPath expression.)

    //country[language[contains(./text(), ../data(@name))]]/data(@name)

10. Return all languages spoken in a country whose name textually contains the
    language name. For instance, German is spoken in Germany, so return German.
    (Hint: Depending on your solution, may want to use data(.), which returns
    the text value of the "current element" within an XPath expression.)

    This one is also correct (according to the "judge") without distinct-values():
    distinct-values(//language[contains(../data(@name), text())])

11. Return all languages whose name textually contains the name of a country
    in which the language is spoken. For instance, Icelandic is spoken in
    Iceland, so return Icelandic. (Hint: Depending on your solution, may want
    to use data(.), which returns the text value of the "current element" 
    within an XPath expression.)

    This one is also correct (according to the "judge") without distinct-values():
    distinct-values(//language[contains(text(), ../data(@name))])

12. Return the number of countries where Russian is spoken.

    count(//country[language = "Russian"])

13. Return the names of all countries for which the data does not include any
    languages or cities, but the country has more than 10 million people.

    //country[not(language) and not(city) and data(@population) > 10000000]/data(@name)
