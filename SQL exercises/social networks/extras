1.  For every situation where student A likes student B, but student B likes a
    different student C, return the names and grades of A, B, and C.

    select h1.name, h1.grade, h2.name, h2.grade, h3.name, h3.grade from
    highschooler as h1 join highschooler as h2 join highschooler as h3 join likes as L on
    h1.id = L.id1 and h2.id = L.id2 and
    h3.id in (select id2 from likes where id1 = h2.id)
    and h1.id <> h3.id

2.  Find those students for whom all of their friends are in different grades from
    themselves. Return the students' names and grades.

    select h1.name, h1.grade from highschooler as h1 where h1.grade not in
    (select grade from highschooler join friend on id = id2 and id1 = h1.id)

3.  What is the average number of friends per student? (Your result should
    be just one number.)

    select avg(count) from (select count(id2) as count from friend group by id1)

4.	Find the number of students who are either friends with Cassandra or are
	friends of friends of Cassandra. Do not count Cassandra, even though
	technically she is a friend of a friend.

	select R.total + S.total from (select count(*)  as total from
	(select id2 from friend where id1 in
	(select id from highschooler where name = 'Cassandra'))) as R,
	(select count(*) as total from (select id2 from friend where
	id1 in (select id2 from friend where id1 in (select id from highschooler
	where name = 'Cassandra'))
	and id2 <> (select id from highschooler where name = 'Cassandra'))) as S

5. Find the name and grade of the student(s) with the greatest number of friends.

    select h1.name, h1.grade from
    highschooler as h1 join highschooler as h2 join friend on
    h1.id = id1 and h2.id = id2 group by h1.id having count(h2.name) = 
    (select max(total) from (select count(id2) as total from friend group by id1))
