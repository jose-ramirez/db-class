*   Find the titles of all movies directed by Steven Spielberg.

    select title from movie where director = 'Steven Spielberg'

*   Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5,
    and sort them in increasing order.

    select distinct year from movie inner join rating 
    on movie.mID = rating.mID
    where stars = 4 or stars = 5 order by year

*   Find the titles of all movies that have no ratings.

    select title from movie where mID in 
    (select mID from movie except 
    select mID from rating intersect select mID from movie)

*   Some reviewers didn't provide a date with their rating.
    Find the names of all reviewers who have ratings with a
    NULL value for the date.

    select name from reviewer where reviewer.rid in
    (select rid from rating where ratingDate is null)

*   Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable
    format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate.
    Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie
    title, and lastly by number of stars.

    select name, title, stars, ratingDate from
    rating inner join movie inner join reviewer on
    movie.mid = rating.mid and rating.rid = reviewer.rid
    order by name, title, stars

*   For all cases where the same reviewer rated the same movie
    twice and gave it a higher rating the second time, return
    the reviewer's name and the title of the movie.

    select T.name, T.title from 
    (((movie join
    rating
    on movie.mid = rating.mid) R join
    reviewer
    on R.rid = reviewer.rid) S join
    rating last_rating 
    on(S.mid = last_rating.mid and
    S.rid = last_rating.rid and
    s.ratingDate < last_rating.ratingDate and
    S.stars < last_rating.stars)) T

*   For each movie that has at least one rating, find the highest
    number of stars that movie received. Return the movie title
    and number of stars. Sort by movie title.

    select title, ms from movie inner join
    (select mid, max(stars) as ms from rating 
    group by mid having count(rid) >= 1) as R 
    on R.mid = movie.mid
    order by title 

*   For each movie, return the title and the 'rating spread', that
    is, the difference between highest and lowest ratings given to
    that movie. Sort by rating spread from highest to lowest, then
    by movie title.

    select title, max(stars) - min(stars) as spread from
    movie join
    rating
    on (movie.mid = rating.mid)
    group by movie.mid
    order by spread desc, title

*   Find the difference between the average rating of movies released
    before 1980 and the average rating of movies released after 1980.
    (Make sure to calculate the average rating for each movie, then
    the average of those averages for movies before 1980 and movies
    after. Don't just calculate the overall average rating before and
    after 1980.)

    select a1 - a2 from (select avg(before.avg) as a1 from
    (select avg(stars) as avg from rating where mid in 
        (select mid from movie where year < 1980)
        group by mid)
    as before), 
    (select avg(after.avg) as a2 from
        (select avg(stars) as avg from rating where mid not in 
        (select mid from movie where year < 1980)
        group by mid)
    as after)
